# Javascript quiz (Basic Level - 3)

Explain as much as you know about objects in javascript?
A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method). For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc.JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in JavaScript.JavaScript is template based not class based. Here, we don't create class to get the object. But, we direct create objects.
In JavaScript, "key: value" pairs are called properties.
he syntax of creating object using object literal is given below:
object={
property1:value1,
property2:value2
.
.
.
propertyN:valueN};

Defining method in JavaScript Object
We can define method in JavaScript object. But before defining method, we need to add property in the function with same name as method.

Accessing Object Properties
You can access the value of a property by using its key.
Using dot Notation : objectName.key
Using bracket Notation : objectName["propertyName"]

An object can also contain another object. For example,
nested object
const student = {
name: 'John',
age: 20,
marks: {
science: 70,
math: 75
}
}

Do you think javascript is the language of the future?
